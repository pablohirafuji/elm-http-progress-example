# Elm Http.Progress Example

Example of using the [Http.Progress](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/http/1.0.0/Http-Progress) Elm package.

[See it in action](https://pablohirafuji.github.io/elm-http-progress-example/).

**NOTE:** Currently (7/2018) this example only works on Firefox, as it is the only browser to track the progress when the content is gzipped. There is a [thread on chromium](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=463622) about this and the reason behind.
